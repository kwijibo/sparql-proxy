Moriarty is a simple PHP library for accessing the Talis Platform. It
follows the Platform API very closely and wraps up many common tasks
into convenient classes while remaining very lightweight. It also
provides some simple RDF classes that are based on the excellent ARC2
class library. Moriarty is in continual beta, subject to occasional
rapid bursts of change.

Moriarty is useful for

* accessing core Store services including sparql, contentbox querying,
  facetting and augmentations
* creating changesets and submitting data to stores
* working with store configuration, field/predicate maps and query
  profiles
* managing data in stores using batch jobs and snapshots
* manipulating generic RDF data with the SimpleGraph implementation
* building data rich applications with simple but powerful tools like
  DataTable and GraphPath
